A file sorter GUI program that lets you manually sort your files using arrow keys

This is still in its early stages so it will be **_very_ buggy** and **_very_ unoptimized**.  
For now, the preview window only works with audio, video, and photos.

## You can test it out for yourself here: https://github.com/jericjan/FileSorter/releases
